# Code versioning using Git



# Getting Started

1. Login to gitlab.sesync.org

The screen you are seeing is the main welcome screen for gitlab. This shows you a list of projects you've subscribed to as well as recent updates.

2. Find our Git lesson repo

In the upper right, search for 'git' and click on the ci_training/git_lessons link.

* This is a group that is part of the ci_training group at sesync. You can create (and we encourage you to) your own group and store your working group's projects in there.
* The repository link on the right gives you a quick link you can copy to other programs when you want to use the repository. There are two ways to access, ssh and http. If you're using a repository a lot, we recommend setting up ssh access to keep you from being asked for a password each time.
* The activity list shows what has been recently updated.
* Click on the commit and you'll see a list of what was changed during that revision.
** Term: revision, the delta between two different saves.
