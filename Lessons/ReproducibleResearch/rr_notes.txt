Reproducible research: who, what, where, why, when, how?


Where?
===============
- backups on disk space/cloud
- intuitive places for instructions: package the instructions with the raw materials. document code, use numbering systems, name files informatively
- share in relevant places and ways. data repositories for different communities (natural/social sciences) like dryad, dataverse, figshare. it is possible to get a DOI for getting credit and being cited. journal rules may dictate some of this. keep in mind it is not useful to share data and/or code in pdf formats.
Supplementary materials are not easily discoverable, not the best place for data you want to be easily re-usable

File types, names, and organization
==============

- There are going to be files. 
- Lots of files. 
- The files will change over time. 
- The files will have relationships to each other. It'll probably get complicated

These practices are easy to implement now and will payoff greatly as your projects become more complex.

Make a file's name and location VERY INFORMATIVE about what it is, why it exists, and how it relates to other things.



To summarize, please think hard at the beginning of your project about how you are going to organize your data as it grows. Something that works well for one file, or for two files, won't necessarily work well for a hundred files. Second, version control your metadata, not your data filesâ€”use a conventional backup system for those. Third, an intelligent structure not only makes your data easier to archive, track, and manage, but it also reduces the chance that the paths in the pipeline get crossed and the data out the end isn't what you think it is. That can save you embarrassment as well as time.


Who
- you, now and in the future
- collaborators, now
- reviewers & editors
- anyone!

What
- lots of terminology: different definitions and contexts
- official standards at different levels, guidelines, best practices for different communities
- core focus (for our purposes) on: access, understanding, sharing

Where
- backups on disk space/cloud
- intuitive places for instructions: package the instructions with the raw materials. document code, use numbering systems, name files informatively
- share in relevant places and ways. data repositories for different communities (natural/social sciences) like dryad, dataverse, figshare. it is possible to get a DOI for getting credit and being cited. journal rules may dictate some of this. keep in mind it is not useful to share data and/or code in pdf formats.

Why
- carrots: getting cited more, being more visible, higher impact work, not re-inventing the wheel
- sticks: guidelines from journals/Science paper about publishing; NSF rules and taking data management plans more seriously; other funding agencies; mandates from congress; your future self!
- risks/costs

When
- things you can do now (file naming, etc.)
- bookmarks and checkpoints in your progress. remember version control tools!
- at publication/submission

How
- tools at different stages of publishing process. show good example of the PNAS paper on sprawl
- software being used - even if not open source software, can share the flow diagram like the gis steps
- what to share and what not to share
