# CSI 2015 Tip Sheet


### ```rstudio.sesync.org```

In RStudio, change directories by clicking the ellipsis [...] in the Files tab of the lower right hand window.

Home directory: ```~```

Group data directory: ```/nfs/yourGroupName-data```

This is the same directory you can access via ```files.sesync.org```

### ```gitlab.sesync.org```

* git clone
* git status
* git add
* git commit
* git push
* git pull


### Finding resources in R

CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/) is the main repository of R packages. The web description of a R package on CRAN (e.g. [raster](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html) links to two types of documentation:

* The reference manual, which is a dictionary of all functions in the package, individually documented (the same info. that is reported under the "Help" tab in RStudio).

* One or more vignettes that introduce the packages' main features, akin to a tutorial.

If you need to know which R packages are available for a certain type of analysis, CRAN [task views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) are a good place to start.
