## Navigating

### ```rstudio.sesync.org```

In RStudio, change directories by clicking the ellipsis [...] in the Files tab of the lower right hand window.

Home directory: ```~```

Group data directory: ```/nfs/yourGroupName-data```

This is the same directory you can access via files.sesync.org

### ```gitlab.sesync.org```

## R/R Studio Environment

* R open source, powerful, widely used
* Flexibility and extensibility (ability to add new features/functions) with packages contributed by other users
* Gateway to data and tools (data shares, home dir, code repositories, command line)
* Four sections:
> 1. scripting window for editing/saving code; can have multiple tabs
> 2. console for interactive commands/results
> 3. top right window tracks R objects in current session; history of commands; interact with code repositories
> 4. bottom right window has tabs for file management, output graphics, help, etc.

* To get help, search under the help tab or type ? followed by the command of interest in the console window
