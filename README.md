## SESYNC Computational Summer Institute 2015

This repo contains a complete archive (data, lessons, tips, etc.) for reference after the workshop. Lesson materials are written in markdown, a simple, text-based style designed for reading and writing on the web. Markdown is readable as plain text, and there are many sites which will render it into html code. For example, you can paste the content of any lesson into the left-hand side here: http://markable.in/editor/. [This](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a good site for more information about markdown.
